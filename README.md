# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
Robin wants to add more polish to the app. So we needed to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. We used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
